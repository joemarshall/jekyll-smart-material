This was the first public live performance with the [Juggling Tracker]({% post_url 2006-06-28-juggling-tracker %}). I did something on a space theme - using loops from the First Man in Space by All Seeing Eye as my music.

It was a bit mental, I think people who already knew what I was doing enjoyed it, but it was a bit confusing for some people who didn't catch onto what the technology was up to until further through the performance.

I used red aerotech glow balls for this - they work great with the tracker. The projections looked really cool in the smoke from the smoke machine. It's a bit hard to see from the photo - on the left is me juggling red glow balls, on the right is a computer output.
