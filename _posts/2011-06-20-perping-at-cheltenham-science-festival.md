*"Breathe in, and your bat goes up, breath out and your bat goes down. Breath quickly and your bat size increases. Hyperventilate, and the ball splits into two. Miss the ball and your opponent scores a point"*

PerPing is a further use of the [gas mask breathing interface]({% post_url 2011-05-09-the-gas-mask-a-probe-for-exploring-fearsome-interactions-alt-chi-2011 %}) originally developed for the [Breathless]({% post_url 2010-10-15-breathless %}) breathing controlled swing ride.

We used the breathing interface to make a selection of games, including PerPing, a two player breathing controlled tennis game somewhat inspired by the classic early video game Pong.

We demonstrated PerPing at [Cheltenham Science Festival](http://www.cheltenhamfestivals.com/science), where several hundred people had a go, and thousands of people watched them play.

PerPing and the other breathing games we designed are also the subject of a paper at ACM Advances in Computer Entertainment 2011.
