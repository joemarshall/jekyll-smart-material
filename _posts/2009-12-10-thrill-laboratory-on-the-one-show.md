I was the technical support for this clip - putting Christopher Biggins on a rollercoaster ([Mumbo Jumbo at Flamingoland](http://www.flamingoland.co.uk/park/news.html)) and recording his physiological responses. This was for the BBC One Show.

Everything worked well, so basically I put together a bunch of gear, coded some videos, then got a chance to ride a few rollercoasters while the rest of the shots were being filmed.
