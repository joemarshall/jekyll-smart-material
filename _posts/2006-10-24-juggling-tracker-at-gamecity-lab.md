I used the [juggling tracker]({{ site.url }}{% post_url 2006-06-28-juggling-tracker %}) to present something called 'Juggling Games' at the GameCity festival in Nottingham, UK.

This was a set of simple target based games that you control by juggling - I had Space Invaders, where juggling shoots (in the direction of your juggling), and Killer Butterflies, where you have to hit the on screen butterflies, and a simple drawing with juggling balls thing.

The people playing were mostly kids and families who had wandered into the event, and this set of toys seemed to suit them well.
