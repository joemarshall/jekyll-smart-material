This paper, published in [Mobile HCI 2009](http://www.mobilehci09.org/) describes two mobile experiences for people who are  cycling, and the unique challenges that this presents.

Designing a pervasive experience for people who are cycling is different to designing for walking for many reasons, which we describe in [the paper (PDF)]({{ site.url }}/uploads/2010/01/ubikequitouscomputing.pdf).

The two projects studied were The Sillitoe Trail a mobile experience based in Nottingham, themed around the work of Alan Sillitoe, and [Rider Spoke](http://www.blasttheory.co.uk/bt/work_rider_spoke.html), a mobile game created by art group [Blast Theory](http://www.blasttheory.co.uk) in collaboration with the [Mixed Reality Lab](http://www.mrl.nott.ac.uk).
