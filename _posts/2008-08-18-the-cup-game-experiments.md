I ran the [Cup Game]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2008-07-01-the-cup-game %}) experiments over a couple of weeks in August, using participants gathered by putting up posters around the university.

The 17 participants were mainly students, with a mixture of postgraduates and undergraduates, and a pretty even mix of men and women. Each person got to see an individual magic performance with the Cup Table, set in a small dark booth hidden at the back of the Mixed Reality Lab. All the audience members said that they enjoyed the cup game which was nice.

The [results ]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2008-09-01-cup-game-experiment-results %})are now available.
