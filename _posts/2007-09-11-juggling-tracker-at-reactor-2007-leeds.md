I did a presentation / performance to go with a paper about the [juggling tracker]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2006-06-28-juggling-tracker %}) at the (re)Actor festival in Leeds.

I did the Juggling like a Bicycle performance again. People seemed to like it.

The setup was in a conference type room, very close up, with me bang in front of the screen. Angling the camera off so it couldn't see the screen meant everything worked okay which was nice.
