Poke that goat is a 2 to 6 player game for mobile devices. Each player chooses a goat, and then they must try and poke their goat as many times as possible. The first player to poke their goat 20 times wins. Because all the action is on a single screen, this leads to a certain amount of chaos, as each player tries to poke their goat whilst trying to block the other goat pokers.

I made it for two reasons: 

Firstly, I wanted to see how a large number of players playing on one device at the same time actually worked. 

Secondly, I decided that at two and a half, it was time for Rose to have her first computer game (see also [her first synthesiser]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2011-11-15-arduino-octo-synth-part-1 %})).  

It is currently available for Android devices - [download it now for free from Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.joemarshall.pokethatgoat "Poke that Goat").
