We were invited to bring the [Broncomatic]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2010-03-01-broncomatic-testing-page %}) to the [National Videogame Arcade](http://gamecity.org/venue/national-videogame-arcade/) in Nottingham.

We spent today fixing up the ride control robot and adding useful functionality like the ability to tweet ride-camera pictures (see [https://twitter.com/BroncomaticRide?lang=en-gb](https://twitter.com/BroncomaticRide?lang=en-gb) for the ride pictures). It's staying there for some weeks (slightly dependent on how long the ride survives).
