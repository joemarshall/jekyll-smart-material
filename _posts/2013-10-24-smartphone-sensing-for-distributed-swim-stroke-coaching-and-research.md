I presented this paper at the [Ubimi'13](http://ubimi.blogspot.co.uk/) workshop at Ubicomp 2013. It describes my ideas for the use of smartphone based technology for swimming training and research. In particular, there is a focus on the combination of the use of realtime feedback to combine nuanced sensing of details of the swim stroke with the swimmer's own awareness of what they are doing.
