[I seek the nerves]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2008-09-04-i-seek-the-nerves-under-your-skin %}) was first run at the [(re)Actor3](http://www.digitalliveart.co.uk) conference.

30 people had a go, which was quite a good turnout for an experience of running through the dodgy end of Liverpool on a wet, dark evening. It appeared to work really well, with some people getting very into it, and no-one getting hurt or even falling over.

I also presented a paper on it during the main conference, the original version of which is available as a [PDF]({{ site.baseurl }}/uploads/2008/11/movementpoems1.pdf).
