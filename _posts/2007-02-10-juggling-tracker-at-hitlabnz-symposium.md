I did a performance / presentation of the [juggling tracker]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2006-06-28-juggling-tracker %}), at the [HitLab NZ](http://www.hitlabnz.org) symposium. This is an event where all the industrial partners, and potential industrial partners of the Hitlab come together for a mini-conference.

It was a surprisingly big audience, maybe 100. I did a presentation on things that can go wrong with interactive performance systems, which hopefully was quite funny too - people seemed to laugh at the right points.
