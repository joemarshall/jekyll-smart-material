I presented this paper ([PDF]({{ site.url }}/uploads/2011/05/file1083-1.pdf)) on my running work at [CHI 2011](http://www.chi2011.org).

I did a lot of work studying '[I Seek the Nerves]({{ site.url }}{% post_url 2008-09-04-i-seek-the-nerves-under-your-skin %})', and used this to suggest some ways of using exercise as part of an interactive system. We suggest that rather than seeing exercise purely as something to encourage people to do with computer systems, we see exercise as something interesting and rich in itself. In particular we argue that doing hard exercise can make people increasingly emotionally involved with the experience which they are taking part in.
