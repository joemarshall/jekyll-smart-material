I seek the nerves under your skin is an interactive poem controlled by how fast you run. I built it to explore experiences where the user is made to push themselves to a point where they are unable to concentrate on their interaction with the computer system, because they are focusing so hard on their physical activity. It encourages people to run extremely hard.
