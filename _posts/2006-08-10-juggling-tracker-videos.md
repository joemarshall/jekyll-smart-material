I've done several videos for various things where I needed to show off the [juggling tracker]({% post_url 2006-06-28-juggling-tracker %}), here are a couple of them.

**The First Demo**
This is the first ever demo video I made. It demos very simply what it does, and some weirdy effects I made using it.
[WMV version (3.5MB)]({{ site.baseurl }}/uploads/2008/12/demovideo-small.wmv) [Div X AVI (21MB)]({{ site.baseurl }}/uploads/2008/12/demovideo-divx.avi)

**Effects Demo**
This demonstrates some more advanced video effects that are possible in the juggling tracker. It also serves as a kind of demo of the way everything is controlled by juggling in the tracker. In this, all the effect transitions, mixing and fading of the music loops, and everything on the screen is controlled by the juggling. How cool is that! Apologies for the somewhat retro 1980s music and visuals.
