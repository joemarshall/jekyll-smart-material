Using Object Interactions to Improve Particle Filter Performance
*J. Marshall, S. Mills and S. Benford* was published in the British Machine Vision Conference 2006.

This paper describes the tracking algorithms used in the juggling tracker. In particular, it describes the way in which the hand and ball tracking interact with each other to create a more robust combined tracker. [PDF]({{ site.url }}/uploads/2008/11/probabilitymaps-yearend.pdf)
