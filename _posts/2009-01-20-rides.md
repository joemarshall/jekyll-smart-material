I have worked as part of a team in the [Mixed Reality Laboratory](http://mrl.nott.ac.uk) (in collaboration with Brendan Walker's [Thrill Laboratory](http://www.thrilllaboratory.com/)) exploring fairground and theme park rides. We have looked at people's physiological responses to rides, and are exploring how one might adapt rides, to provide a ride experience tailored to the individual rider.
