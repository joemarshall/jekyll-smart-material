A lot of my work involves building and studying games and entertainment systems. I have a particular interest in 'exertion games', games which the player must exercise in order to play, which I consider to be interesting and fun as a genre of gaming. I have also published a series of papers arguing that we should build such games simply for the fun of playing them, rather than building them with the mission of encouraging healthy behaviour, both because it is uncertain whether they have potential for such results, and because I believe that focusing on health over gameplay leads to poor games.
