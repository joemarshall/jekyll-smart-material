I presented [this paper (PDF)]({{ site.baseurl }}/uploads/2010/04/marshall-chi-deception.pdf) at CHI 2010, which is basically a shorter version of the work on the Cup Game and use of magic.

I presented it using a hand drawn presentation that I did in an old notebook, which seemed to work well (and it was jolly quick to draw the diagrams this way).
[![notebook]({{ site.baseurl }}/uploads/2010/04/notebook-300x223.jpg "notebook")]({{ site.baseurl }}/uploads/2010/04/notebook.jpg)

During the presentation, I demonstrated misdirection by creating a situation where I put a large pink soft toy elephant on top of my head, yet no one in the room spotted the elephant, which worked like a charm.

Anyone interested in a very much more in depth version of the work in the paper (and more) might be interested in a look at my [thesis]({% post_url 2009-03-31-thesis-videos %}), which covered this experiment, and also two other performance situations in which deception occurred. There is also a short video on that page. Oh and there is also some more stuff in the [magic theme]({{site.baseurl}}/projects/Magic) on this site.
