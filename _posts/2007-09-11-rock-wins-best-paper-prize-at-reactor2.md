[Rock]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2007-09-08-rock %}) was run in public for the first time, at the [(re)Actor2](http://www.digitalliveart.co.uk) Digital Live Art conference.

People seemed to really like it, I even had one person ask me if they could take it home with them. It won the Best Paper award, which was nice too.
