[VR Playground](http://thrilllaboratory.com/vrplayground) is a VR based artwork based around a playground swing, which we built with Brendan Walker at [Aerial](http://www.aerial.fm) as part of our ongoing collaboration [Thrill Laboratory](http://thrilllaboratory.com/vrplayground). In VR Playground, your swinging motion is translated to different motions in the virtual world, for example zooming along a road through a city. It's really exciting, and has been very successful - It has been touring for a year now, and over 15,000 people have ridden it. It has been shown at Norfolk & Norwich Festival, Hull City of Culture, featured in the Cultural Program for the 2018 Winter Olympics etc.
