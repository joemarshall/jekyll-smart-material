The Cup Table has two possible states, in which technology is respectively hidden and revealed.

In the hidden state, the top and back of the table is covered with a black cloth. The area below the table at the front is also covered with a black cloth. This means that the technology in the table is invisible to the audience member. It also blocks the cups from my view, making  it seem as if the performer cannot possibly see what is happening on the table.

In the revealed state, the audience member can see a laptop computer beneath the table, and a camera above the table, pointing down onto the top of the cups. They can then see that the cups are being tracked by the computer using the camera view.

The hidden state is used for a trick in which the audience do not even know that a computer exists. Afterwards, the computer is revealed, and further tricks are brought in which appear to use the computer openly.
