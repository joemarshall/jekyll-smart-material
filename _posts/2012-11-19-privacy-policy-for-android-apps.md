This is a privacy policy for Android Apps published by Joe Marshall (see a list on [Google Play.](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=Joe+Marshall))

1) My apps don't collect personal data or unique device identifiers or anything else or talk to any servers. 

2) Google Play collects data as to how many people have downloaded my apps, and what devices and operating system versions they are using.

3) Some apps may have adverts in. These are supplied by Google AdMob. If you want to know what they do about privacy read their [privacy policy](https://www.google.com/admob/home/privacy). You can mess with your advert settings on your device by going to 'google play', and selecting 'settings'.
