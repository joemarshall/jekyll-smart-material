Touchomatic Astonishing Airship Adventures  is a two player cooperative game based on touch between two players. Each player holds onto a sensor stick with one hand, and you must fly an airship which flies higher when your other hands touch. If you fly close to the ground, you pick up coins and score points. Fly too high and you will run out of fuel.

Paul Tennent and I built this arcade cabinet based game, which is currently installed at the [National Videogame Arcade](http://gamecity.org/venue/national-videogame-arcade/) in Nottingham.

It plays a game called Astonishing Airship Adventures, where players must touch their hands together to fly higher and release to turn off the engine.
