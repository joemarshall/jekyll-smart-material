My PhD student Rich wrote a paper about a game called Balance Ninja. In Balance Ninja, players must balance facing each other at either end of a balance beam. They are hooked up to a galvanic vestibular stimulation system (GVS), which affects your balance. When one player leans to the side, the other player's balance is affected in the opposite direction. Players must battle to make the other player fall off whilst staying on the beam themselves.

The paper [PDF]({{ site.url }}/uploads/2017/01/balance_ninja_chiplay2016.pdf) won an Honorable Mention award at CHI Play 2016.
