The Broncomatic went to the [GameCity Festival](http://gamecity.org/), where it was run by [Stefan Rennick Egglestone](http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~sre/) with the help of some other people from the lab, as I was busy doing some other work. 116 riders rode it during the day, and there were pretty decent crowds of people watching from the sound of it.

I did some work before this event on making the control panel more sturdy and resilient, and it held up fine, even with quite a large number of riders, which was a big relief.
