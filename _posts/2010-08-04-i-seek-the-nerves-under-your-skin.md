I Seek the Nerves Under Your Skin is a motion poem, an interactive experience combining poetry with running. When you start I Seek the Nerves, you put on a pair of headphones and a fluorescent 'poetry jacket'. As soon as you start walking, you hear a poem begin in your headphones. As the poem continues it gets faster and more intense, but in order to hear it, you must move faster. By the end of the poem, you will be sprinting flat out.

Because it is entirely self contained, I Seek the Nerves can be run in pretty much any location that you are happy to run around in.

**Try I Seek the Nerves Under Your Skin**
I am currently interested in exploring how I Seek the Nerves works in a variety of locations. You can try I Seek the Nerves free of charge in and near Belper, Derbyshire.

I'm running it on Tuesday 7th, Wednesday 8th and Thursday 9th September. On Tuesday, I'll be at Belper leisure centre from 18:30 onwards until the Belper Harriers club run starts, and you're welcome to turn up and have a go. I'll be the one with the stylish flourescent jackets and headphones! The Wednesday and Thursday, you can contact us to book a time and arrange a location where you'd like to do it, and we come to you with the poetry jacket and headphones.

There is some strong language, so this is not suitable for under 18s.

Places for Wednesday and Thursday are limited - to book a time and a place, email:[groups@joemarshall.org.uk](mailto:groups@joemarshall.org.uk)
