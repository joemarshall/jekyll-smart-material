This is the sensing technology behind the Rock, and was published and presented at Pervasive 2008. In the presentation, I actually used a banana as my touch sensitive object, because I wanted to use something I could easily get hold of in Sydney. I think I am probably the first person ever to make a touch sensitive banana.
