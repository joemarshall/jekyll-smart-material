I presented this paper at CHI 2017, where we received a Best Paper Honorable Mention award. In it we discuss how exertion games work is not necessarily well founded in research from health fields, with a big literature analysis of how work in exertion gaming specifically misrepresents one particular public health paper in order to push the idea that computer games make people fat.
