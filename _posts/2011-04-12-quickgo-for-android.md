Android phones have lovely built in google maps navigation. However, the default 'car home' application, and the navigation application are a bit fiddly to enter addresses into compared to a dedicated sat nav system. For example, the onscreen keyboard has letters and numbers separately, with a button to switch between them, and it does not take up much of the screen, in order to allow for content.

You also have to go through a bunch of steps to get to the point where you enter an address - click navigate, select 'type destination', then enter it using the small onscreen keyboard.

QuickGo is basically a full screen keyboard for entering addresses or postcodes. Once you enter the postcode in, pressing the search button launches navigation to that address.

Download it from Android Market on your phone.

It is free, but if you like it, feel free to paypal me a donation (to paypal at joemarshall.org.uk)
