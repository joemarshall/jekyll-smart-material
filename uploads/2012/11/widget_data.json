I am studying how we might design interactive systems for active use while walking, running, cycling or any other form of movement activity.\r\n<strong>Previous work<\/strong>\r\nPrior to taking up the fellowship, my work was a mixture of personal projects, such as my work on interactive running systems and the use of extreme exercise in interactive systems, and larger team projects, such as the 'Day in the Park' project, developing and studying interactive fairground and theme park rides, and the 'Vicarious' project exploring the use of physiological sensor data as a narrative element in television and video productions.\r\n<strong>Thesis<\/strong>\r\nMy PhD was titled \"<em>Creating Illusion in Computer Aided Performance<\/em>\". It studied the use of deception and illusion in computer performance, by studying several of the <a href=\"..\/?cat=3\">projects<\/a> described on this web page.
